Need to check a few things in the KIM API.  The following
things appear to not work (though they may be caused
by the Python interface and not directly by KIM).

    KIM_API_init_str : does not return a bad value when
        initialization is not successful

    KIM_API_get_index : appears to modify memory that it
        does not own.  atoms.get_pbc() changes from
        start to end of checkIndex call.
